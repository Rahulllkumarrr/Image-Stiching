# Image-Stiching
In this project we are going to stitch two images together using Computer Vision techniques.

### RIGHT IMAGE

So basically we have two images of same location.
One is the left view and other is the right view.
There are common points between two images.
So we are going to use these common points to stitch the two images together.


## RESULT

After code execution we get one stitched paranoma image which is blended together so look as if it is only one image.
